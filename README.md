# 👋 Hi, I'm Kavya

I specialize in **Angular**, **React**, and **Node.js**, with deep experience in:
- Mono-repos (Nx, Lerna)
- Micro-frontends
- State management (NgRx)
- Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) architectures

I enjoy simplifying complex systems, mentoring engineers, and integrating AI to create better user experiences. I’m known for shipping high-quality products under tight deadlines while raising the bar on architecture and code quality.
